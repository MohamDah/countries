## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - JS library

### What I learned

I haven't made many projects using APIs until now, so it was pretty intimidating, but that's how you learn new things, isn't it? I learned more about using fetch and async functions, and other stuff like `Promise.all` and using React Router redirects. There are definetly a lot more things that I learn that I can't list here, but overall, this was a very educational project for me.

### Continued development

I would like to use APIs more in the future. I hope to get better at fullstack development and learning to use APIs effectively will be very useful.
